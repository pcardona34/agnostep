# agnostep
A PiSiN like Desktop for All

## The Goal
While announcing [PisiN Desktop](https://github.com/pcardona34/pi-step-initiative) at the GNUstep Discuss List, it happened that some people expressed the wish that the project was available too for other architectures, i.e. not only tied to the Raspberry Pi hardware.

So there is the attempt to accomplish the wish: an Agnostic GNUstep Desktop, named AGNosStep.
Code will be provided as soon as possible...
