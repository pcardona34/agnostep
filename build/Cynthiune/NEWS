version ?.?.?:
- MusicBrainz support is now optional, and updated to libmusicbrainz
  5.x (preferable) or 3.x.  Support for version 2.x has been removed
  as it is deprecated and unusable with the current server software.

version 0.9.5:
- some files were separated into a new Cynthiune framework, so that other
  developers can now start writing extension bundles and so that bundles
  do not have to rely on internal symbols either;
- added support for WMA and ASF audio formats through the new WindowsMedia
  bundle;
- added support for the MPC audio format through the new Musepack bundle;
- added support for midi files through the Timidity bundle, which requires
  timidity to be installed;
- added support for the aRts sound daemon through the new aRts output bundle;
- added flags on GNUstep to ignore compilation of all or specific bundles:
  set disable-bundles or disable-{oss,esound,mod,mp3,ogg,flac,windowsmedia,
  musepack,timidity} to "yes" to do this;
- song filenames can now be dragged from Cynthiune to other applications on
  MacOS X;
- fixed a bug that could make the MP3 bundle hang forever when seeking the
  beginning of an empty file;
- fixed a bug in the MP3 bundle where it would skip the first few frames of a
  tagged file;
- the MP3 bundles returns a more accurate duration of buggy vbr files;
- added a "Tools" menu;
- added a Song inspector to display and edit song metadata;
- added support for resolving song metadata through the MusicBrainz database;
- we now use an image to indicate which song is currently playing instead of
  using the selection mechanism;
- fixed a bug that would mess up the selection when the playlist was sorted;
- added a playlist status label that displays the number of songs and the
  total time of the playlist, as well as the time taken by all the selected
  songs, if any;
- fixed a bug that would crash Cynthiune and maybe screw the default playlist
  when a selection of songs was dragged to a position with a distance to the 
  end of the playlist inferior to the amount of songs being dragged;
- the playlist code has been totally rewritten to be modular. Meanwhile,
  playlists with relative filenames can now be saved and also read;

- the playlist menus were replaced with a more convenient and standard toolbar;
- added German translation, thanks to Julian Frede;
- updated Italian translation;

- added Traditional Chinese translation, thanks to Yen-Ju Chen;
- added Spanish translation, thanks to Pablo Di Noto;
- added Slovak translation, thanks to Saso Kiselkov;
- added ability to manipulate the song selection with the keyboard in the
  playlist, the valid keys are the home, end and arrow keys (with or without
  shift) to alter the selection, delete and enter to remove songs and activate
  the selection in the player;
- many GUI tweaking and enhancements.

version 0.9.4:
- made the Services menu and mechanism work again;

  with Apple's documentation;
- added the ability to send a bug report from the Info menu;

  songs in the stored playlist, reducing the speedup brought by the use of
  an NSKeyedArchive;
- fixed a bug that was preventing the player to skip invalid songs;
- fixed a bug that was requesting the player to start playing when the column
  headers were double-clicked on GNUstep;
- fixed a bug in the Esound bundle that was preventing the socket to be
  reinitialized with the correct song rate and channels informations;
- add a "Cleanup" entry in the "Remove" dropdown menu that performs the
  removal of all the songs that either were not recognized with their format
  or are missing in the filesystem.
- fixed a bug that was preventing the OSS output bundle to start correctly
  when no dsp device was set in the preferences.

  - added the Mod format module relying on libmodplug (thanks to Rob Burns),
    adding support for 23 types of tracker file formats (mod, s3m, ...);
  - added the AudioFile format module relying on libaudiofile, adding support
    for 7 types of uncompressed sound formats (wav, aiff, ...);

  NSKeyedArchiver/NSKeyedUnarchiver.

- fixed the display of UTF8-encoded song metadata;
- added Italian translation (thanks to Roberto Pariset);
- MacOSX users can select whether Cynthiune will display textured or regular

  songs faster to start since no lock has to be instantiated.

  clicking on it;
- when the selection of songs is changing, the total time taken by those songs
