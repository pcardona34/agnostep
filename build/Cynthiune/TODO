* frontend:
- make Cynthiune playlist-oriented (document interface?);
- make Cynthiune themeable, if possible by supporting Winamp/XMMS skins;
- the info menu should include a "Check for update..." option;
- add the ability to remove duplicate songs;
- having a dock-icon compatible with the systray freedesktop.org standard;
- support for multimedia keyboards;
- having the appicon show the title of the current song + remaining time
  or progression of the song, depending on how the player displays the
  time in the player window;
- having a jukebox-style song selection and manipulation system;
- update the preferences with options to tune all that can be tuned;

* formats:
- AAC/MP4 bundle
- A52 (AC3) bundle
- ability to play HTTP streams;
- compatibility layer with XMMS plugins;
- add exporter bundles, to convert streams into .wav and .ogg files;
- format-specifiec metadata in the song inspector;

* players:
- CD writing output bundle;
- implement CD reading, modify the open dialog so that it can read CD tracks;

* playlist:
- thread operations which are resource consuming such as adding Songs, to
  avoid the player from being interrupted.
- write a full-featured playlist manager;
- the sort order should be defined through a defined chain of parameters to
  compare with each other, configurable from the preference panel;

* translations:
- write translations;

* documentation:
- write a user manual;
- a dev. manual (plugins) ?;

* maybe:
- scripting and/or remote control interface?

* API:
- rename the new classes of the Cynthiune framework to comply with the
  GNUstep/Cocoa naming convention

* BUGS:
- leaks?;
- drag & dropping mechanism put files at the end of the list, notwithstanding
  the positiong they were dragged to, things need to be cleaned up and
  rearranged between PlaylistController and TableViewController;
- the logic behind the management of the current song needs to be separated
  and put in a PlayerController only, not the PlaylistController;
- playing too fast on certain arches;
- take care of the FIXME's;
