This is a BackSpace module.  I named it NickSpace after the noted human Nick Manjoine, because it was inspired by a characteristic behavior of his.

The distribution includes a fat binary (Intel and Motorola) and source.  The source should compile readily under NS 3.1 and 3.2, but will probably require some makefile tweaking for earlier versions.

If you like it, or do anything further to it, let me know.

A decade on here, I got permisson from Micheal, who is a friend of mine to distribute this module with InnerSpace under the GPL.

So here it is, one of the classic BackSpace modules now under GNUstep, and soon Mac OS X.
