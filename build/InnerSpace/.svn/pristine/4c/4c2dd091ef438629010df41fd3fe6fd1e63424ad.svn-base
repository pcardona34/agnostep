These modules are ports of those from the BackSpace days.   It was fairly
easy to get them to work under InnerSpace.app.  

You need to copy these into your home directory 
at GNUstep/Library/InnerSpace after you build them so that InnerSpace can
load them.

NOTE:
The savers Polyhedra.bproj, SporView.bproj, and Space2View.bproj were available
from next-ftp.peak.org with code and source available.  I assume these are in 
the public domain.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
