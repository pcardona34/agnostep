QixView

This is an addin screen saver for the BackSpace application.

Along with this file the following files should be in the
distribution:

-rw-r--r--  1 me            278 Nov 10 18:13 Makefile
-rw-r--r--  1 me           3246 Oct 26 20:12 QixView.h
-rw-r--r--  1 me           3954 Oct 26 20:12 QixView.m
-rw-r--r--  1 me          24850 Nov 10 18:22 QixView.o

Simply cd to the directory containing these files and type "make".
This will create QixView.o, which should be moved into your BackSpace
directory.

Typing "make install" will install QixView.o in
/LocalLibrary/BackSpaceViews.  You can change that directory by
editing the Makefile.
