======

Each directory "xxx.definition" defines a theme for HighlighterKit. Gemas.app 
will search these themes at user path "$(GNUSTEP_USER_DIR_LIBRARY)/HKThemes". 
You can make your own themes. Just create a directory "xxx.definition", where 
xxx is your desired name. And copy the content of any other theme inside this 
directory. Then you only need change the definition of the syntax files 
according with the HighlighterKit's documentation. And next time you launch 
Gemas.app your theme will be available at preferences panel.
