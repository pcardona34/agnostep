<p>
FlexiSheet formulas have a consistent structure. Each formula has two sides, right and left, which are connected by an equal (=) sign. 
</p>
<p>
In this example, the averaged value of the data in items Quarter1 through Quarter4 is shown in the Average Sales item:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average&nbsp;Sales = avg(Quarter1 .. Quarter4)
</p>
<h4>Selection</h4>
<p>
The left side of a formula specifies a range of categories, items or cells to which a formula will apply. In the example, the left side, Average Sales, is the name of an item.
</p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>
The right side of a formula defines how the selection is to be calculated. In the example, the right side includes a function, avg, which calculates the average of the contents of items Quarter1, Quarter2, Quarter3 and Quarter4.
