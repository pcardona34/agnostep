If you take the time to design a model well, you'll find it much simpler to maintain and share with others. Use tables and views to decompose your problem or analyses into manageable pieces, which together can be synthesized to provide insight and answers.
</p>
<p>
Although your analysis can be cleanly decomposed into multiple tables and views, information within one table can reference and share information in other tables through intertable formulas, and linked categories. 
</p>
<p>
A table can be viewed in any number of different formats, called views. When a cosmetic change is made to a view (e.g., we boldface a cell), only that view is changed. However, when data is modified in a view (e.g., we input new data), all views, while retaining their original formatting, will simultaneously display the updated information.
