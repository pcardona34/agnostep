FlexiSheet Technology Preview
-----------------------------

DO THIS BEFORE NEXT BETA RELEASE (BUGS AND SUCH):

*** category linking and groups (some fixed, full test pending)

*** printing
*** search

*** documentation for statistic functions missing

*** extending selection with shift key doesn't work
*** inspecting cell style does not work at all!  Exceptions!!!

*** finish implementation of FSWorksheet, fix inspector
    should take care of:
**  Selection (focus) is not set on undo/redo!
**  Selection (focus) is not retained when moving tabs!
*   Moving categories is buggy and needs fixing (also make it undoable)
*   Undo is incomplete (selections are not restored, etc).

*** pnv financial funcion is broken
*** tab inspecting.

*** Fix resizing problems with groups (most visible with more than one category in one dock)
*** Fix editing problems with groups and multiple categories in one dock
*** Category linking needs to be tested and documented.
*** Remove deallocated objects from undo manager!

**  Item hiding.

*   Undo while editing cell raises exception (abort editing).

URGENT ADDITIONS (definitely soon):

**  Investigate @ prefix to functions for "ignore text".
**  Formula evaluation is not complete yet.
**  Select function returns a selection!  How to implement?
**  Statistic functions, documentation for all implemented functions.
*   layout information not read from Quantrix file.
*   Dates cannot be calculated in formulas.

NICE TO HAVE:

*   Charts.
*   Perfect Quantrix import.
*   More and better toolbar support.
*   Better Notification structure (instead of delegation).
*   Auto-save.
*   Ultra fast GUI (ie more caching at the right places)
