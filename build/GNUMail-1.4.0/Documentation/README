If you want very good documentation on how to get GNUMail running on
your computer, look at the following documentation provided by
Dennis Leeuw:

For a quick installation guide, read the following lines.



Compiling GNUMail for GNUstep
===============================================================================

To install GNUMail, install first GNUstep. You can get GNUstep at:

http://www.gnustep.org
 
Be sure to fully read and understand the GNUstep installation procedure. You
can read a comprehensive guide on how to install GNUstep on Unix systems here:

http://documents.made-it.com/GNUstep/Build/

Once you've installed GNUstep, you have to install Pantomime.
To install Pantomime, see:

http://www.collaboration-world.com/pantomime/

Once you've installed Pantomime, you have to install Addresses for GNUstep.
To install Addresses for GNUstep, see:

http://giesler.biz/bjoern/en/sw_addr.html

Once you've installed GNUstep, Pantomime and Addresses for GNUstep, you can 
install GNUMail. To compile it:

make
make install 

To run it:

openapp GNUMail

To run it in a different language (English, French, German):

defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSLanguages '(French)'
openapp GNUMail



Compiling GNUMail for Apple Mac OS X
===============================================================================

Get Pantomime and GNUMail sources from the URLs above.

Uncompress them by using OpenUp (http://www.stepwise.com/Software/OpenUp/)
or from the command-line using tar:

% cd ~/Desktop (or whereever you saved the source files)
% tar -zxvf GNUMail-x.y.z.tar.gz
% tar -zxvf Pantomime-x.y.z.tar.gz

Start Xcode. Open ~/Desktop/Pantomime/Pantomime.xcodeproj and
choose from the menu Build -> Build. Close the project.

Now, we are ready to compile GNUMail.

Open in Xcode ~/Desktop/GNUMail/GNUMail.xcodeproj and
choose from the menu Build -> Build.



Compiling and installing the Emoticon and PGP bundles
==============================================================================

If you are an OS X user and you've compiled GNUMail, the Emoticon
and PGP bundles have also been compiled when compiling the "GNUMail" target.

Under GNUstep, simply do the following commands:

% cd Bundles/Emoticon; make
% cd ../PGP; make
% cd ../../

To install the bundles on OS X, simply copy GNUMail/build/Emoticon.bundle
and GNUMail/build/PGP.bundle to ~/Library/GNUMail/.
For example, one would do:

% cp -R build/Emoticon.bundle ~/Library/GNUMail/

Under GNUstep, simply copy GNUMail/Bundles/Emoticon.bundle
and GNUMail/Bundles/PGP/PGP.bundle to 
~/GNUstep/Library/GNUMail/. For example, one would do:

% cp -a Bundles/PGP/PGP.bundle ~/GNUstep/Library/GNUMail/

You must restart GNUMail if you've installed bundles and you want to use them.
